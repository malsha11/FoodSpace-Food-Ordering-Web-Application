# MERN-FoodSpace-Food-Ordering-Web-Application

This FoodSpace Online Food Ordering Web Application has been designed to fill a specific niche in the market by providing small restaurants with the ability to offer their customers an online ordering option
without having to invest large amounts of time and money in having custom software designed specifically for them. The system, which is highly customizable, allows the restaurant employees to easily manage the site content,
most importantly the menu, themselves through a very intuitive graphical interface.

The web Application, which is the only component seen by the restaurant customers, is then built dynamically based on the current state of the system, so any changes made are reflected in real time. Visitors to the site, once registered,
are then able to easily navigate this menu, add food items to their order, and specify delivery options with only a few clicks, greatly simplifying the ordering
process. Back in the restaurant, placed orders are promptly retrieved and displayed in an easily readable format for efficient processing.

The aim is to automate its existing manual system by the help of computerized equipments and fullfledged computer software, fulfilling their requirements, so that their valuable data/information can be
stored for a longer period with easy accessing and manipulation of the same. Basically the project describes how to manage for good performance and better services for the clients.
